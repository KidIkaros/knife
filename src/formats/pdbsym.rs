//! Names from a Microsoft PDB.
//!
//! A stripped Windows binary carries almost no symbols of its own: an export
//! table if it is a DLL, and otherwise nothing, so every routine reads as
//! `sub_140001234`. The names are not lost, though — they are in the PDB the
//! compiler wrote, which for Microsoft's own binaries is a public download and
//! for anything built in-house is sitting next to the executable. Reading it is
//! the difference between a listing you have to reconstruct from scratch and
//! one that tells you what each function is called.
//!
//! Only names are taken here. A PDB also describes types, locals and line
//! numbers; those are a larger piece of work and are deliberately not attempted,
//! because a half-applied type is worse than none.
//!
//! The match is checked before anything is used. A PDB from a *different build*
//! of the same program will load perfectly and name every function wrongly —
//! quietly, and in a way that looks like success. The GUID and age in the
//! executable's debug directory exist to prevent exactly that, so a mismatch is
//! refused rather than applied.
