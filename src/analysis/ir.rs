//! The decompiler engine: an intermediate representation and the passes that
//! turn a lifted instruction stream into something that reads like C.
//!
//! The disassembler already hands us basic blocks and a control-flow graph. The
//! engine lifts each instruction into a small typed IR, then runs passes over
//! it: expression propagation folds a run of `mov`/`lea`/`add` into the single
//! expression it computes, liveness-driven dead-store elimination drops the
//! intermediate assignments that propagation made redundant, and constant
//! folding tidies the arithmetic. What survives is one statement per thing the
//! code actually does.
//!
//! Control flow is then structured: dominators and post-dominators drive a
//! recursive emitter that reconstructs `if`/`else` and `while` from the graph.
//! The reducible skeleton reads as nested C; the few edges that break nesting
//! (shared `switch` tails, a jump into a common handler) become an explicit
//! `goto` to a labelled block, so the flow is preserved exactly rather than
//! approximated. It is still not a full decompiler: type recovery is deliberately
//! conservative and currently limited to ABI parameters, returns, literals, and
//! known library prototypes.
//! The honest rule holds throughout: an instruction the lifter does not model
//! becomes an opaque `asm(...)` statement, never a guess.
